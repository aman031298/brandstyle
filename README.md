Project Title : Brand Style E-commerce Website
Problem Statement/Opportunity :E-commerce provides an easy way to sell products to a large customer base. However, there is a lot of competition among multiple e-commerce sites. When users land on an e-commerce site, they expect to find what they are looking for quickly and easily. Also, users are not sure about the brands or the actual products they want to purchase. They have a very broad idea about what they want to buy. Many customers nowadays search for their products on Google rather than visiting specific e-commerce sites. They believe that Google will take them to the e-commerce sites that have their product.
The purpose of any e-commerce website is to help customers narrow down their broad ideas and enable them to finalize the products. In my website I create a cloths sale website that help to find cheap rate and good quality products to helps the people to full fill their desired needs.

Project Description : The primary goal of an e-commerce site is to sell goods and services online. This project deals with developing an e-commerce website for Online  cloths Sale. It provides the user with a catalog of different cloths Accessories available for purchase in the store. They have the option to see each and every Details about the project. If the have any Problem customer support Facility is Also Available.
I have created a cloths sale website named Brand Style using Html, Css, Javascript. and azure technology. its helps the customer to finds the good products. In the website I make four pages named home, about, services, contact us. and etc.
